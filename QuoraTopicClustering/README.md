# Quora Topic Clustering
Quora is a popular knowledge sharing platform where I once used to share my thoughts. The platform is based on a Question-Answering format and is well known for itâ€™s simplistic design and a very smooth user experience.

When questions are added to Quora they are tagged automatically by a bot by default based on the context of the question and can be later edited by the user. These tags reflect the topics under which this question can fall under. Here is a general outlay of a question
